# GitHub lazy page template

An easy to maintain page template for GH Pages.

This setup uses Bootstrap for a clean look, Jekyll (through GitHub Pages) for markdown rendering, and a lazy-blogger-friendly workflow.

### Workflow:

Adding a new post: Simply create a new markdown file in the `posts/` folder. The homepage will automatically update with the new post.

Deploy: Push your changes to GitHub, and the site will automatically build on GitHub Pages.
